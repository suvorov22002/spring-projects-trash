     * Get and Put Principle
     * *- Use an extends wildcard when you only get values out of a structure.
     * *- Use a super wildcard when you only put values into a structure.
     * *- And donâ€™t use a wildcard when you both get and put.
     *
     * And there are two exceptions:
     * *- You cannot put anything into a type declared with an extends wildcard except for
     * the value null, which belongs to every reference type.
     * *- You cannot get anything out from a type declared with a super wildcard except for
     * a value of type Object, which is a super type of every reference type.
